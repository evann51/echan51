  <b>q0 Did you have to consult resources beyond your Devo-generated on-ramp? Your answer should be a single binary digit.</b>
  - 1
  
  <b>q0b If answer to preceding question is 1, cite all resources consulted -- including verbal consultations and/or neighbouring team's readme. 1citation/line.

  <b>q1 Only to be answered after you have finished... At this point, which FEF do you prefer, and why? Your answer to this Q should be the only portion of your submission that differs from that of your teammate.</b>
  - I prefer BootStrap, I feel that it is more specific but still simple for a more polished look. Foundation seems like it requires a lot of code to create the bare minimum look.
