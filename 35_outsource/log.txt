im trying to make a python and flash webapp through my localhost. it will be a blog that users may login to post and reply to others.
-> given base code

"Can you help me recreate a blog website using HTML, CSS, and Python? The project should have the following features:

    A user feed that displays all posts sorted by most recent at the top.
    Functionality for logged-in users to view, create, and edit blog posts.
    Use an SQLite database to store posts and user information.
    Implement session management to reduce login friction.
    Ensure the site has consistent templates and styling. Please provide detailed steps and code snippets for setting up and implementing these features."
-> improved base code

make a requirements.txt
-> made requirements.txt

the requirements.txt should only use flask jinja and datetime
-> lessened modules used

now change the app.py to match these modules accurately
-> updated app.py to reflect less modules

jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'current_user' is undefined
-> fixed error

jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'form' is undefined
-> didnt fix error

review the login template
-> fixed error in previous message

we will not use flask_wtf
-> removed flask_wtf module

logging in doesnt redirect to home page
-> fixed redirecting

how does loginc check user identities if theres no register page? make a register page that can be accessed from the login.html
-> added register templates and code

good job! now let me make posts on the home.html page
-> posting enabled

good job!
-> improvements to everything
